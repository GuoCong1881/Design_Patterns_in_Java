     * When do you use adapter pattern?
     *
     * You can use an adapter whenever you need to transform one API or interface into another. Adapters allow classes
     * with otherwise incompatible interfaces to work together!
     *
     * Adapters typically "wrap" an existing interface to adapt it to a different interface.
     * One common use of the adapter pattern is to wrap legacy APIs, but adapters can be used with all sorts of APIs.
