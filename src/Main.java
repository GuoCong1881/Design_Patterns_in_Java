     * SOLID: Principles of Good Software Design

     * - Single Responsibility Principle
     * - Open-Closed Principle

     * A design pattern is a general solution to certain kinds of common design issues that occur in software development.
     * These patterns provide guidelines for how you can organize and write software.
     * They will not design your code for you â€” It's still up to you to fill in the blanks and customize
     * each pattern to fit your use case.
     *
     * This lesson covers three broad categories of software design patterns:
     *
     * - Creational patterns: patterns that deal with creating objects
     * - Behavioral patterns: patterns that deal with how different objects interact
     * - Structural patterns: patterns that deal with how different objects fit together

     * Creational Patterns:

     * - Strategy pattern
